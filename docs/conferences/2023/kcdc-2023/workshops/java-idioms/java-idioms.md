Try to use methods that are english-y (`.equals()` vs `==`, `== 0` vs `.isEmpty()` etc)  

- If you see yourself using a for loop over an integer, there is likely an "english-y" solution that's built into the language.  

Use `strip()` instead of `trim()`. It covers more languages than just English.  

Idioms can change over time as improved solutions are introduced to the language.
