Lecture and labs for 2023 KCDC half day training

(adapted/updated from https://github.com/boyarsky/2020-devnexus-java-idioms)

## General

Open the lab/src/main/java file for the current lab and implement the methods so the tests pass using the contraints in the comments/instructions. Do not delete the "start" and "end" comments as they are used by the tests.

Run the equivalent lab/src/test/java file to see if you got it right.

JUnit 5.9.3 is provided in the lib folder in case your IDE doesn't work with the default version of JUnit you have installed. Add all jars in lib to your project's classpath to use. 

## Open in IntelliJ
