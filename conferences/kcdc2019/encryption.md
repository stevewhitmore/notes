# Not Screwing Up Encryption

http://github.com/sstur for slides

Encryption is a subset of cryptography

## Look Into

- hashing for pwd but also service interaction for SBS
- Hashing vs Encryption
- Async vs Syncronous Encryption
- DKIM for email verification of sender identity
- SSL cert 2048 and RSA key

**Always use strong salt for hashing pwd**
