# Electronics for Programmers

## Resources to check out
- https://github.com/pulcher - has slides there 
- Also has a YT channel where he gives tutorials
- Getting started in Electronics by Forrest M Mims III

## Basic Tools
- Digital multimeter - DMM
- Power source
- Bread board (positive/negative charges on slides)
- Wire and things to cut wire
- Eagle (software)
- Fritzing software

> SparkFun and Arduino to get started (DO IT!!)

## Resistor
Slows down current that passes through it
- Bands indicate resistance

## Copneitors (sp?)
- LIke tiny batteries
- Measured in Farads
- Rated by Voltage

**Look into Series vs Parallel circuitry**

## Diodes: One way valve
Rated on forward and reverse currents
