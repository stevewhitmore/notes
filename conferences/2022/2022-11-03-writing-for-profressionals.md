# Writing Tips For Professionals

## The first sentence matters most

We learned the following structure for a report/document:

1. Intro
2. Guts
3. Conclusion
    a. BAM! (the most important message of the document)

People today want it inverted. Try to fit the 5 W's in your first sentence. 

### Email subjects

The highest email open/response rates use:

- Subject line = 4 words
- Length = 100 words (or less)
- Casual greeting = "Hi Paula" or "Hey Paula"
- Reading level = 3rd grade

### Email hacks

1. Ask a question in the subject line
    - This is mostly a problem with spam if you use certain keywords with it (like "credit card" or "invoice", etc)
2. Stickk to 4 sentences
    - For busy executive - just 2 sentences (or 50 words)
3. Try multiple choice
    - Or make a recommendation
4. Push pleasantries to the bottom

## Simplify your sentences

Learn to edit yourself. Can it be shorter without losing the content?

"Managers should consistently attempt to limit their discretionary expenditures to no more than 10% over budgeted levels"

vs

"Managers shouldn't go more than 10% over budget"

Shortest, simplest sentence possible: 5-12 words.

### Use lowest possible grade level

- Office docs: 10th grade
- Public: 6th grade
- Email: 3rd grade

### Use active voice

"The new invoicing policy was approved by the client"

vs

"The client approved the new invoicing policy"

Get rid of passive verbs (words ending with "-ing" or "-ed")
Put the subject at the start.

## Get rid of "word echo"

"You will love our customer support specialists. Our customer support specialists offer complete software troubleshooting by phone. These customer support specialists are available 24/7."

vs

"You'll love our customer support specialists who offer comprehensive help over the phone 24/7."

## Write faster

1. Plan (how long it'll be, what'll be in the doc, resources, etc)
2. Research
3. Prioritize (most important at the top, least at the bottom)
4. Write
5. Format
6. Edit
7. Proof

This will be much faster than winging it and then revising it a lot (which I do).
