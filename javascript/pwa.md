# Progressive Web Apps

A regular web app with a few layers added on

- Service Workers
- App shell
- Manifest

## Service Workers

Runs independently of frontend and server so it can operate even if the app is closed. 

> Requires HTTPS (unless running locally)

The Fetch API & Promises are an essential part of working with Service Workers in a modern Progressive Web App.
